            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-[0.84] font-normal">1. Mission: To become the de facto online space for readers, authors, and publishers, connecting people through their taste in books and helping publishers reach the audiences they currently miss. The world's biggest book club. 


2. Vision: A thriving cultural ecosystem where book discovery is social, personalised, and profitable for creators. Get Lost becomes the backbone of reader culture worldwide. 


3. Core Narrative: Book discovery is broken. Algorithms push trends. Amazon pushes transactions. Readers are overwhelmed. Publishers can't reach their audiences. Get Lost fixes this by making discovery human, emotional, social, and psychographically intelligent. It builds communities around shared taste and enables monetisation of the connections they create.</p>
